#Haskell-Lisp
A project inspired from the abstractions of Haskell



## Abstractions Examples
- `auto-curry` - automatically curries a function based on its type signature
- `curryl` - automatically curries an entire list of functions by
## Coming Eventually
- a reader macro that would cause [] to curry a function and maybe even funcall a function
